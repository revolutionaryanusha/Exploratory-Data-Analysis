# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Dealing with missing data is a common challenge in data analysis. This
can occur due to various reasons like faulty sensors, human error, etc.
Simply dropping the rows or columns containing NULL values is not a
viable solution as it may result in loss of unique patterns.
To address this issue, we can utilize the information from neighboring
rows or columns to fill in the missing data. This approach can help in fixing
a considerable portion of faulty data, approximately 50-60%.
In this code, this problem was solved using  Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn
